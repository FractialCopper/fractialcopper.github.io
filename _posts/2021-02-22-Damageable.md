# Motivation

Usually when making a mechanic the idea for it is to be reaplicabble to any object really fast. Here I'll use a really simple idea to make an object (a character or a prop) being able to recieve damage and act accordingly.

Lets imagine

```cs
{
  class ABCD{
      public void abc(){
          syntax highlight = abcd;
      }
  }
}
```
